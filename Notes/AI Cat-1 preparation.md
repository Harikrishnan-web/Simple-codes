## 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of mimicking human-like behaviors such as thinking, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

- AI enables machines to operate with human intelligence.
- Machines can perform tasks like reasoning, learning, and understanding.

### Applications of AI

- Autonomous vehicles (e.g., self-driving cars)
- Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant)
- Games (e.g., Chess, Go)
- Expert Systems (e.g., medical diagnosis tools)
- Robotics (e.g., manufacturing robots, humanoids)
- Personalized recommendations (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)

## 2. Why Study AI?

- Solve complex real-world problems efficiently (healthcare, traffic, marketing)
- Build machines that operate in risky environments (robots in hazardous zones)
- Enhance technological innovation and open new opportunities
- Develop virtual assistants and intelligent software systems

---

## 3. Goals of AI

- **Replicate human intelligence**: Machines that reason and think like humans
- **Solve knowledge-intensive tasks**: Domains requiring expert knowledge
- **Integrate perception and action**: Agent perceives environment and acts accordingly

## 8. Intelligent Agents and Environments

### What is an Agent?

- An entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it using actuators.
- Examples:
  - Humans (sensors: eyes, ears; actuators: hands, legs)
  - Robots (cameras, motors)
  - Software agents (mouse inputs, keyboard; screen output)

### Agent Structure and Cycle

```
Perceive -> Reason -> Act -> Observe next percept
```

### Sensors and Actuators

- **Sensors**: Devices for perception (e.g., camera, microphone)
- **Actuators**: Components to perform actions (e.g., wheels, robotic arms)

## 13. Problem-Solving Agents and Search

### Problem Solving Overview

- A problem is defined by initial state, a set of actions, goal test, and path cost.
- Problem-solving agents use search strategies to find sequences of actions to reach goals.

### Search Algorithms

Two main types:

- **Uninformed (Blind) Search**: No extra info about states beyond problem definition
- **Informed (Heuristic) Search**: Uses heuristic knowledge to guide search

## 15. Summary of Important Java Code Concepts

### Agent Cycle (Pseudocode)
